# CPU Profiling Guide

## Profiling on host
Share an easy-to-use profiler and flamegraph tool: https://github.com/koute/not-perf.git

Record samples:

```shell
nperf record -p `pidof compute-node` -o perf.data
```

Generate flamegraph: 

```shell
nperf flamegraph --merge-threads perf.data > perf.svg
```

## Profiling remote compute nodes
You can profile remote compute nodes from a local machine by simply type the following command.
```shell
./risedev ctl profile --sleep [seconds]
```
All compute nodes will be profile for a given `seconds` time and generated flame graph will be transferred to your local machine `.risingwave/profiling/`.

Note: To profile compute nodes remotely, please make sure all remote nodes have a public IP address accessible from your local machine (where you are running `risedev`).
